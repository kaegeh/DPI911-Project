# Screen Capture - T1113

## Description

Attackers can capture the screen of a compromised host. 
To demonstrate this technique, we ran PowerSploit's Get-TimedScreenshot module. This module can take screenshots at regular intervals and save them to a specified directory.

## Assumptions

Attackers have used the Get-TimedScreenshot module on a compromised host, which forwards events to Splunk.

## Execution

## Detection

### Splunk filter

NOTE: This filter is specific and relates to the specific attack technique itself.

To detect the technique we demonstrated, we should monitor Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational Event ID 4104 (command executed) events that contain the "Get-TimedScreenshot" string, which would indicate execution of the PowerSploit module with the same name.

host="AGENT-2" source="WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational" EventCode="4104" "Get-TimedScreenshot"
