# File Permissions Modification - T1222

## Description

Attackers change file permissions to enable malicious activity using those files.

To demonstrate this technique, we are going to use Cacls to try to modify permissions for a DLL file in Windows/System32. Access was denied, but the event should still be logged.

We can see the event in Event Viewer, Windows Security Log:

## Splunk Filter

To detect this technique, we should monitor Windows Security Log for event ID 4670 (permissions on an object were changed/attempted to be changed)
