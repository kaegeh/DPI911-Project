# Image Indicator Blocking - T1054

## Technique Description

Attackers can disable sensors or block traffic/events from being received by sensor to hinder detection. For example, if an attacker gets privileged access to a Splunk event forwarder, he may simply stop the Splunk process. It would prevent events from the compromised forwarder from going to the SIEM console.

## Detection

### Splunk Filter

NOTE: This filter is specific and relates to the specific attack technique itself.

To detect the technique we demonstrated, on the centralized server one should regularly check and monitor the last time a remote sensor has been heard from.
