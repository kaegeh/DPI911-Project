# Port Monitors- T1013

## Technique Description 
Spoolsv.exe can be used to load a DLL located in System32 folder that is ran under SYSTEM permissions or by writing the pathname of the DLL to HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors. These techniques can be used to load malicious code at start-up which are persistent and will execute as SYSTEM.   
To demonstrate this technique we edit the registry of HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors. 

## Assumptions
Malicious code should be run at start-up.
